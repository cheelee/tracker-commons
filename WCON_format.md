# Introduction

WCON (Worm tracker Commons Object Notation) is a text-based data interchange format for *C. elegans* trackers.  It is a constrained subset of [JSON](http://www.json.org/).  It is designed to be both human and machine readable and to facilitate data exchange and inter-operability for worm tracking data that is independent of platform and the language used for implementation.  Our hope is that working in a common format will also encourage code sharing and development within the community.

WCON has a minimal core description so that the basic data from a tracking experiment can be parsed by any software that is WCON-compatible, regardless of resolution or whether the file is from a single- or multi-worm tracker.  At the same time, we recognise that most groups that develop and use worm trackers have unique features they are interested in.  We have included support for the most common additional features and recommendations for how custom features should be included while preserving basic tracking data.

## An example of a WCON file

The following is an example of a very small WCON file consisting of a single animal tracked at two time points.

```JSON
{
    "units":{"t":"seconds", "x":"mm", "y":"mm"},
    "metadata":{"strain":"N2", "who":"Rex Kerr"},
    "data":{
        "id":"1", "t":[0.0, 0.3],
        "x":[[17.2, 17.3, 17.9, 18.6, 18.8], [16.4, 16.9, 17.5, 18.1, 18.4]],
        "y":[[2, 2.8, 3.3, 3.7, 4.6], [1.8, 2.4, 3, 3.4, 4.3]]
    }
}
```

The key features of the format include a required *units* section so that it is clear what time and space values mean, an optional *metadata* section that can specify commonly-varied parameters such as strain or name of experimenter, and a *data* section that consists of entries that specify the animal (by *id*), the time points (in an array), and the spine along the worm at that timepoint given by separate *x* and *y* coordinates.  (A single x and y value is permitted at each timepoint also, if for example the tracker does not have any shape information.)

In general, the `data` section can be an array to support tracking of multiple animals; in the example above, there is a only a single animal so it is just a single record.

Since WCON files are valid JSON, any of a wide number of packages that read JSON can be used to import the data.

## Formal schema

A formal schema, in JSON, specifying most of the below is available as [`wcon_schema.json`](wcon_schema.json).

## Basic implementation

### WCON must be JSON

A WCON file **must** be valid JSON.  This allows general-purpose JSON parsers to read WCON files.  Such parsers are typically much faster and much better debugged than ad-hoc parsers.  WCON data can then be extracted from the JSON data in memory.

We recommend either `.json` or `.wcon` as a file extension.

### Nomenclature

A JSON _object_ is a set of key-value pairs.  The key is always a string; the value can be anything.  This structure is useful for identifying data by name.

A JSON _array_ is a list of values.  The values can be anything, and need not be the same as each other.  However, in the WCON specification, all arrays do contain the same type of value.

A particular value may be _required_ or _optional_.  Optional values may simply be left out when not present (the whole key-value pair, if part of an object).  Values may also be _single-valued_ or _arrayed_.  A single value is just a single JSON entity of appropriate type.  An arrayed value is zero or more such values inside a JSON array.

If a value must be stored in an array, the specification will say so.  Otherwise if the value is _arrayable_ it means that if there are multiple items (or zero items) they can be specified in an array, but single items can appear alone.  If a value is required and arrayable, then the array must not be empty.  If it is optional and arrayable, an empty array is equivalent to the value being missing.

### File structure

A WCON file contains a single JSON object with a minimum of two key-value pairs: `units` and `data`.  The value for `units` is an object that defines the temporal and spatial dimensions of the experiment as strings.  `data` specifies the tracking information, including time and position information, for the animal or animals tracked.

#### Example

A WCON file with separate entries for each timepoint and animal:

```JSON
{
    "units":{"t":"s", "x":"mm", "y":"mm"},
    "data":[
        { "id":"1", "t":[1.3], "x":[[15.11, 16.01]], "y":[[24.89, 24.63]] },
        { "id":"2", "t":[1.3], "x":[[22.01, 22.35]], "y":[[8.06, 8.96]] },
        { "id":"1", "t":[1.4], "x":[[15.21, 16.09]], "y":[[24.85, 24.58]] }
    ]
}
```

#### Units

Any numeric quantity followed on a per-animal or per-timepoint basis must have its units defined in an object:

```JSON
{
    "units": {
        "t": "s",
        "x": "mm",
        "y": "mm"
    },
    "data":[]
}
```

We recommend that this be done not just for values specified in the base WCON format but also inside custom data blocks.

Readers are not required to understand these units and may instead trust that the units are all consistent and use sensible defaults.  Writers, however, are required to report their units so that full-featured readers can translate between units, and so that experimenters can know what the data is supposed to represent.

The WCON readers and writers provided in the Tracker Commons package internally represent times in seconds and distances
in millimeters; when it is practical, we encourage other labs to adopt these to reduce the risk of loss of precision or inaccurate values due to unit conversions.  Seconds can be specified as one of `"s"`, `"second"`, or `"seconds"`), and millimetres are specified as one of `"mm"`, `"millimetre"`, or `"millimetres"`, or the American English versions "millimeter" or "millimeters".

For compound units, `*` can be used for multiplication, `/` for division, and `^` for exponentiation.  For instance, a unit of acceleration could be written `"mm^2/s"`.  Use `"1"` for a unitless quantity (or `"%"`, as appropriate).  `""` is treated as `"1"`.

Other numerical values may be used in the expressions: for instance, `"t":"0.04*s"` would allow frame indices in a data set gathered at 25 FPS to be interpreted as times.  Likewise, a program could report coordinates as raw pixel values and set "x" and "y" units accordingly.

`"units"` is required and must be single-valued.  Units must be specified for all quantities used.  If the data set is non-empty, that means there must be units at least for `"t"`, `"x"`, and `"y"` since those are required.  It is permitted to specify units for variables that do not exist.  Although an empty `"data"` section is permitted (meaning there is no `"t"`, `"x"`, or `"y"`), WCON readers are allowed to fail if units for `"t"`, `"x"`, and `"y"` are not supplied.

#### Data

A single data record is an object with four required keys, as described below, that contains data for one animal at one or more timepoints

The `"data"` field in WCON is arrayable and contains data record objects.  The array may be empty if there is no data.

The data record objects require these keys:

1. Each worm is identified by an `id` field containing a JSON string.  (Software that generates numeric IDs should convert the number to its corresponding string.)

2. The time of a recording is specified by `t` (a JSON number).  It is arrayed, even if there is only a single timepoint, and may not be empty.  For a series of timepoints, the times should be increasing in value.  Every other numeric value must have the same number of entries as `t` has, where the `i`th entry corresponds to the value(s) at the `i`th time-point.

3. The body position of an animal is given by `x` and `y`.  These are arrayable at each timepoint so that `x` and `y` are arrays of arrays.  However, if tracking is done at low resolution and the worm is defined using a single xy-coordinate, `x` and `y` may have a single numeric value at each time (as usual with quantities that may be arrayed).  At each timepoint, the `x` and `y` entries must be the same length.

Note: A data array may contain the same ID multiple times with different timepoints.  It should _not_ contain the same ID with the same timepoint multiple times.  Allowing repeats enables easy merging and splitting of data across several files or chunks of analysis.

A WCON file with arrayed t and corresponding nested arrays for `x` and `y`.

```JSON
{
    "units":{"t":"s", "x":"mm", "y":"mm"},
    "data":{ 
        "id":"1",
        "t":[
             1.3,
             1.4,
             1.5
        ],
        "x":[
             [12.15, 13.01],
             [12.09, 12.95],
             [12.07, 12.92]
        ],
        "y":[
             [2.34, 2.74],
             [2.37, 2.76],
             [2.39, 2.77]
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Unknown Contents

**Any software that reads WCON should ignore any unrecognised key-value pair**. This is essential to make WCON flexible and allows the inclusion of custom features and additional information not required by the basic format. Below we specify a method for including custom features and other additions that are included in the accompanying software examples.

#### A Word about Numbers

All numeric values may be floating-point.  However, JSON does not support infinite or not-a-number values permitted by the IEEE754 standards that are used by almost every programming language.  Since WCON must be valid JSON, custom extensions to JSON (i.e. _not JSON_ but almost) like using `infinity` unquoted to denote a floating-point positive infinity, must be avoided.

If possible, the best solution is to simply leave out non-finite numbers.  However, in some cases (e.g. with arrayed `t`) it may be more practical to indicate missing data inline.  If you wish to embed not-a-number values, use `null`.  Avoid positive or negative infinity; this is not physical data anyway, so can just be replaced with `null`.

#### Minimal Readers

A minimal reader must be able to read `"id"`, `"t"`, `"x"`, and `"y"` from the `"data"` section as described above.  It must also support optional reading of origins from `"ox"` and `"oy"` as described later in this document, so that the xy data makes sense.

#### Minimal Writers

A minimal writer must write units for every field it uses for numeric data (i.e. at least `t`, `x`, and `y`), plus a data section with at least the fields `"id"`, `"t"`, `"x"`, and `"y"`.

## Including custom features

Even seemingly primitive features such as speed can have many variants (centroid vs. midbody vs. head; calculated over a window vs. frame-by-frame; etc.).  Therefore, having a standard feature called "speed" is not sufficiently flexible for wide use, and in any case it is impractical to specify in advance all quantities that may be of interest to all researchers.  Instead, WCON files allow custom features by using group-specific tags that are easily identifiable by `@` followed by a unique identifier.

For software developed in worm labs, use the lab's strain designation as a unique identifier.  A current list of lab strain designations (the first code in capital letters) is available from the [CGC](http://cbs.umn.edu/cgc/lab-code) or [WormBase](https://www.wormbase.org/resources/laboratory).  If a single group has multiple feature sets, the strain designation can be followed by a suffix separated from the lab code by a non-letter character (e.g. `"@CF Rex"` or `"@OMG_1.5"`).  For groups without a strain designation, choose an identifier that is clearly not a lab strain identifier (i.e. avoid an identifier which is two or three capital letters).

If a feature could be interpreted by other programs and has units that are supported, it is preferable to list the feature by name and let the WCON reader convert the units if needed.  However, it is also possible to store features in other less-accessible forms, such as an array; this may be more compact or faster to read if one does not anticipate that any other software could make use of the feature.

Here is an example of a WCON file with three custom features with units:

```JSON
{
    "units":{
        "t":"s", "x":"mm", "y":"mm",
        "speed":"mm/s",
        "curvature":"1/mm",
        "width":"mm"
    },
    "data":{
        "id":"1",
        "t":[1.3],
        "x":[[12.11, 11.87]],
        "y":[[5.72, 5.01]],
        "@OMG":{ "speed":[0.34], "curvature":[1.5], "width":[0.103] }
    }
}
```

Note that the features are arrays of length 1 to match the time.

Here is the same file but with an unconverted feature vector instead:

```JSON
{
    "units":{
        "t":"s", "x":"mm", "y":"mm"
    },
    "@OMG": { "feature_order":["speed", "curvature", "width"] },
    "data":{
        "id":"1",
        "t":[1.3],
        "x":[[12.11, 11.87]],
        "y":[[5.72, 5.01]],
        "@OMG":[[0.34, 1.5, 0.103]]
    }
}
```

Note that the custom `"@OMG"` tag is used both at the top level (in this case, to specify for the custom reader the order of the parameters), and within each data entry.

Custom features inside a data record may be any type of JSON value, but _if_ they are meant to apply to each timepoint they must either be an array of the same length as the number of timepoints, _or_ a JSON object whose keys map to arrays of the same length as the number of timepoints.  This is essential to allow WCON readers to select subsets of the data by time.

For features that describe an entire plate rather than properties of individual worms (such as density or aggregate number), the values should be specified in a custom block outside of `data`:

```JSON
{
  "units":{
      "t":"s", "x":"mm", "y":"mm",
      "speed":"mm/s",
      "curvature":"1/mm",
      "width":"mm",
      "density":"1/mm^2",
      "aggregate number":"1"
  },
  "@OMG": {
      "plate_features":{
        "density":0.035,
        "aggregate number":8
      }
   },
  "data":{
      "id":"1",
      "t":[1.3],
      "x":[[12.11, 11.87]],
      "y":[[5.72, 5.01]],
      "@OMG":{ "speed":[0.34], "curvature":[1.5], "width":[0.103] }
  }
}
```

This example presents only a small number of possibilities for how a custom reader could store information within a WCON file.  The driving principle is that the custom readers and writers can do whatever they need to, so long as it is valid JSON, and any units that ought to be automatically converted are specified in the `"units"` block.

## Common additions supported by the Tracker Commons project

It is expected that users will take advantage of the flexibility of the WCON specification to create derivatives.  The following examples are handled by the full-featured readers and writers in the Tracker Commons project.  We recommend that general-purpose code written in other languages also handle these cases.

### Local constants

Some values vary by animal but not from time to time.  These may be specified as _local constants_ even when the time is arrayed in order to save space: instead of repeating the value many times in an array, the value is only given once.  Entries that must be read by a minimal reader may _not_ be local constants in order to simplify interpretation.  Optional values that may be local constants are specified below.

### Units

We recommend sticking to seconds and millimetres for time and distance and denoting those with `"s"` and `"mm"` to make automated parsing as easy as possible.  However, we recognize that these units may not always be natural, so the following should be recognized as common variants for units.

A WCON parser should, if it's going to interpret units, handle the following SI prefixes:

| Prefix   | Abbreviations | Value     |
| -------- | ------------- | --------- |
| centi    | c       | 10<sup>-2</sup> |
| milli    | m       | 10<sup>-3</sup> |
| micro    | u µ μ   | 10<sup>-6</sup> |
| nano     | n       | 10<sup>-9</sup> |
| kilo     | k       | 10<sup>3</sup>  |
| mega     | M       | 10<sup>6</sup>  |
| giga     | G       | 10<sup>9</sup>  |

_Note: JSON must be unicode, so the micro-symbol must be encoded as unicode.  There are two choices: "micro symbol" `U+00B5` or "greek mu" `U+03BC`.  Both should be handled.  Some software does not understand unicode, however, so writing `u` is preferred._

The following units should be handled (including both variants of meter/metre and celsius/centigrade):

| Unit       | Abbreviations |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| second     | s sec         |
| minute     | min           |
| hour       | h             |
| day        | d             |
| metre      | m             |
| meter      | m             |
| inch       | in            |
| micron     | *(none)*      |
| fahrenheit | F             |
| centigrade | C             |
| kelvin     | K             |
| celsius    | C             |
| percent    | %             |

Abbreviated and full versions must not be mixed.  For instance, both `"ms"` and `"milliseconds"` are okay, but `"msecond"` and `"millis"` are not.  Words may be pluralized or not.  Capitalization is significant: `"mm"` and `"Mm"` are not the same (millimetre vs megametre)!

If a numeric quantity is dimensionless, specify the units as an empty string `""` or the string `"1"`.

Compound units can be built with the operators `*` (multiplication), `/` (division), and `^` (exponentiation, with integer powers only).  Scalar factors can be included also (e.g. `"7*day"` if the units are weeks, or `"in/72"` if the units are points).  To write a reciprocal, a dimensionless `1` can be inserted.  For instance, a frequency might be represented by `"1/s"`.

Tracker Commons software will automatically convert units to the standard internal representations (e.g. inches to mm) for all fields specified in the `units` block.  It _will_ look inside anything with a custom tag.  It will _not_ look inside the `settings` block in `metadata`, nor will it look inside unknown fields.

As an example, inside

```JSON
{
    "units":{"t":"s", "x":"12*in", "y":"12*in", "e":"min", "q":"%"},
    "metadata":{
        "q":45,
        "@XJ":{ "foo": { "e": 2 }, "yes": "I think so"},
        "settings":{"q": 4, "r": 5}
    },
    "data": [{ "id":"1", "t":[0], "x":[1], "y":[2], "@XJ": {"e": [3], "f":[{"p": 4}]}}]
}
```

the `q` inside `metadata` would be converted from percent to a fraction, the `e` inside `foo` inside `@XJ` inside `metadata` would be converted to seconds, the `q` inside `settings` inside `metadata` would not be converted, the `e` in `data` would be converted as would the `e` in `@XJ` in `data`, and the `p` inside `f` inside `data` would not be converted.

### Experiment and software metadata

Information about experimental conditions and software versions is critical for reproducibility across labs.  JSON's flexibility makes it straightforward to include experimental conditions directly in tracking files.  This has the advantage that the data and corresponding metadata will not be separated, making the tracking data more durable.  If further tags are required, they can of course be added, but where appropriate we recommend using the following tags.  We also recommend that additional tags be inside a custom tag for the lab in question to document who to ask to understand the contents.

An example WCON file with a complete metadata section is given below.

```JSON
{
    "metadata":{
        "lab":{ "location":"Ivory Tower, room 512", "name":"Wiggly Things Lab" },
        "who":["J. Smith", "Suzie Q."],
        "timestamp":"2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z",
        "temperature": 20,
        "humidity": 40,
        "arena":{ "type":"petri", "size":35 },
        "food":"OP50",
        "media":"NGM",
        "sex":"hermaphrodite",
        "stage":"dauer",
        "age":38.4,
        "strain":"CB4856",
        "protocol":[
            "dauer induction by method in J. Doe, 'Get Dauers', J. of Stuff, v1 p234",
            "worm transferred to arena 1-2 minutes before recording started"
        ],
        "interpolate":{ "method":"cubic", "values":["x", "y"] },
        "software":{
            "name":"Suzie's Worm Knower",
            "version":"1.1.3",
            "featureID":"@suzq",
            "settings":"Note: hardware/software config goes here (any valid JSON)"
        }
    },
    "units":{
        "t":"s", "x":"mm", "y":"mm", "temperature":"C",
        "humidity":"%", "size":"mm", "age":"h"
    },
    "data":{
        "id":"1", "t":[1.3], "x":[-5.3], "y":[6.4], "@suzq":[true, true, false, true]
    }
}
```

#### Metadata fields in detail

All entries in the metadata object are optional.  Custom tags may be included in the metadata object.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **id** | This is a JSON string that identifies the experiment.  If it is essential to unambiguously identify an experiment on the basis of this entry, we recommend using a universally unique identifier (UUID). |
| **lab** | This is a JSON object that specifies the laboratory in which the work was done.  Valid fields include _location_ (to specify physical location or address), _name_ (to indicate the name of the laboratory as necessary), _contact_ (text describing how to reach someone (e.g. address or email); may be arrayed), and _PI_ (to indicate the principal investigator of that lab).  Since it is conceivable that an experiment could be done jointly in more than one lab (e.g. in shared space), the lab field may be arrayed. |
| **who** | This is an arrayed set of JSON strings that specify the name(s) of the experimenter(s). |
| **timestamp** | This should specify the time corresponding to `t = 0` in the data, using the [ISO-8601 combined date/time format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).  Fractional seconds and time zones are optional.  The field is single-valued. |
| **temperature** | The temperature at which the experiment takes place.  The units should be specified in the `units` block, but are assumed to be Celsius.  The field is single-valued. |
| **humidity** | The relative humidity at which the experiment takes place.  Since this is normally expressed in percentage, but dimentionless units do not default to percentage, take care to specify units of `"%"` in the `units` block.  The field is single-valued. |
| **arena** | This is a JSON object that specifies the place in which the worms are being recorded.  Subfields include _type_ which is a string description of the arena (e.g. "plate" or "slide"), _size_ which is either a single value or an array of two values which indicates the diameter or extent in each relevant direction, and _orientation_ which is a string describing how the plate or slide is oriented.  For `orientation`, use `"toward"` or `"away"` to indicate that the surface of a plate is pointing towards the camera or away from it (in the latter case one would be imaging through the agar).  The field is single-valued. |
| **food** | The food, if any, present during the experiment, as a JSON string.  If no food is present, and you wish others to know, write `""` or `"none"` rather than leaving the entry absent so it can be distinguished from the case where food is present but the metadata entry is not provided.  The field is single-valued. |
| **media** | The media on which the animal is placed, as a JSON string.  The field is single-valued. |
| **sex** | The sex of the animals, as a JSON string.  If there is a mixed population, it cannot be conveniently indicated here; instead, a custom tag should be used to specify on an animal-by-animal basis.  The field is single-valued. |
| **stage** | The stage of the animals.  If left blank, `"adult"` is normally assumed. |
| **age** |  The age of the animals, with time units as specified in `units`.  If used in aging studies, the value should be the total age of the animals, not "days of adulthood".  If the animals underwent an extended period of larval or dauer arrest, but are now a different stage, it is preferable to explain the details as text in the `protocol` section and leave this field blank.  The field is single-valued. |
| **strain** | The name of the strain as a string.  It is recommended to just have the strain designation using standard nomenclature, not extended information about the genotype.  The field is single-valued. |
| **protocol** | A text description of the protocol for the experiment.  This may be arrayed. Free-form comments regarding the experiment should typically go here. |
| **interpolate** | This is a JSON object that specifies how data may be interpolated via splines.  There are two fields: _method_ specifies the type of interpolation, e.g. `"quadratic"` or `"cubic"` for splines or `"pchip"` for piecewise cubic Hermite interpolating polynomial, and _values_ is an array of strings indicating which variables are included (in their natural pairs).  If `"t"` is included, it indicates that each other variable can be interpolated in time.  This may be arrayed to specify different interpolation for different values.  Note that WCON readers and writers are not expected to provide interpolation; this is information for analysis or visualization software. |
| **software** |  A JSON object that specifies relevant features of the software used to capture and/or analyze the data.  Valid subfields are _name_ (the name of the software package), _version_ (a string containing the version number), _featureID_ (an array of strings that state which custom tags the software produces, as a convenience for those wishing to know what to expect), and _settings_ which may be any JSON entity that describes parameters of the software (units will not be converted within this block).  The software field may be arrayed; the first value is presumed to be the software that captured the data, while later entries represent subsequent post-processing steps. |

#### More on interpolation

Although interpolation may be specified in the metadata it is strongly discouraged to write WCON files whose data can only be interpreted if interpolation is properly performed.  Thus, smoothing methods that have control points far from the actual data (B-splines and Bezier curves, for instance) should not be used.  Different choices for spline endpoints are recommended to be specified after a space, e.g. `"cubic not-a-knot"`.

### Worm orientation

To completely define a worm's orientation, it is necessary to know which part of the skeleton corresponds to the head and which side of the worm is dorsal or ventral.  Use `"head":"L"` to indicate that the head is the first xy-coordinate, `"head":"R"` to indicate that the head is the last xy-coordinate, and, if you wish to be explicit, `"head":"?"` to indicate that the orientation is uncertain.  `"ventral":"CW"` indicates that the ventral side is clockwise from the first xy-coordinate (whether or not the first coordinate is the head), `"ventral":"CCW"` that the ventral side is counterclockwise from the first point, and (if desired) `"ventral":"?"` that the dorsoventral orientation is unknown.  One or both of head and ventral can be arrayed if orientation changes within an object but in that case it must have one entry for each entry in `t`.  Alternatively, both may be local constants.

Knowing the head position and the ventral side, it is possible to infer whether a worm is crawling with its left or right side touching the agar surface, but only if it is known whether the image is recorded looking onto the agar surface or looking through the agar.  To allow this determination to be made, please use the `orientation` field in the `arena` field of the metadata.

An example WCON file with orientation information:

```JSON
{
    "units":{"t":"s", "x":"mm", "y":"mm"},
    "data":{
        "id":"1", "t":[1.3], "x":[[7.2, 7.8]], "y":[[0.5, -0.3]],
        "head":"L",
        "ventral":"CCW"
    }
}
```

### Variable origin and centroid position

The origin used to define the worm's xy-coordinates can change over time to reduce file size by reducing the magnitude of the numbers in the worm coordinates.  For example, the origin at each time could be the centroid of the worm skeleton or the position of its head in plate coordinates.  Using this convention, as worms move, the scale of their skeleton coordinates does not increase as they move away from an arbitrary plate frame of reference.  The origin coordinates are defined by `ox` and `oy`.  If `t` is an _n_ length array, `ox` and `oy` if present must also be _n_ length arrays.  If `ox` and `oy` are present, every other value at that timepoint is assumed to be relative to that origin.  **Minimal readers must understand origin position to represent data properly.**

It is often the case that the centroid of an animal is known with considerably greater accuracy than any other position.  The centroid positions can be specified by `cx` and `cy`, and must be given for every time point if given at all.

Note that you must specify units for `cx`, `cy`, `ox`, and `oy` if you use them.  Also, note that they must be used in pairs: a `cx` without a `cy` is uninterpretable.

Here is an example WCON file using origin and centroid points:

```JSON
{
    "units":{
        "t":"s", "x":"mm", "y":"mm",
        "cx":"mm", "cy":"mm", "ox":"mm", "oy":"mm"
    },
    "data":{
        "id":"1", "t":[1.3], "x":[[7.2, 8.1]], "y":[[0.5, 0.3]],
        "ox":[32.4], "oy":[9.2], "cx":[7.676], "cy": [0.384]
    }
}
```

### Perimeters

Worms are long and skinny and therefore are well-approximated by a single central line, or "spine".  However, the perimeter or outer contour information is also frequently collected by worm trackers and may contain features not seen in the spine, especially if the worm self-intersects (for example during an omega turn).  WCON provides two optional ways to specify perimeter information.

#### Point-based perimeters

Point-based perimeters are specified much like spines but using `"px"` and `"py"` fields (typically arrayed) that together draw out the contour around the animal.  The last point is assumed to be joined to the first one (does not need to be repeated).  For instance, this represents a one mm square:

```JSON
{
    "units":{"t":"s", "x":"mm", "y":"mm", "px":"mm", "py":"mm"},
    "data":{
      "id":"1", "t":[0], "x":[4], "y":[3],
      "px":[[4.5, 4.5, 3.5, 3.5]], "py":[[3.5, 2.5, 2.5, 3.5]]
    }
}
```

If the head is known, it should go first.  Points should appear in counterclockwise order.  If the tail is also known, its position may be specified by using a `"ptail"` field that specifies the index (counting up from 0).  For instance, if the opposite corner of the square was its tail, the above data entry should contain `"ptail":2`.

Point-based perimeters work with arrayed `t` values just like spines do: `px` and `py` become arrays of arrays, and `ptail` if present becomes an array.  `ptail` may also be a local constant (single value to be used for all timepoints).

#### Walk-based perimeters

Walk-based perimeters are useful to represent raw image segmentation results separating a worm from the background.  A `"walk"` is contained in its own JSON object with three fields with one such object per timepoint.  `"px"` is an array of three numbers that represent the x,y starting pixel location and the side-length of a pixel.  `"n"` is either a single number representing the number of elements in the walk, or two numbers with the second indicating the pixel where the tail is (if known); if the tail is known, the walk must start at the head.  `"4"` is a string containing an encoded binary representation of a 4-connected set of steps over the pixels.  Counterclockwise vs. clockwise order of pixels cannot be assumed.

In detail, `"4"` contains a Base64-encoded representation (using standard MIME format without newlines) of an 8-bit binary array.  This array is to be read two bits at a time, starting from the lowest-order two bits in the first byte in the array.  Each two bits represent a step in one of four directions: `00` means a step in the negative x direction `01` is positive x, `10` is negative y, and `11` is positive y.  The same square as in the point-based example could be represented as follows: the steps are -y, -x, +y which is binary 110010; the Base64 encoding of an array containing only that is "Mg".  Thus, this represents a one mm square also:

```JSON
{
    "units":{"t":"s", "x":"mm", "y":"mm", "px":"mm", "py":"mm"},
    "data":{
      "id":"1", "t":[0], "x":[4], "y":[3],
      "walk":[{"px":[4.5, 3.5, 1], "n":3, "4":"Mg" }]
    }
}
```

Note that this represents three edge pixels per character as opposed to 10-20 characters per pixel for the point-based representation, so for large outlines of raw pixel coordinates this reduces the size of the data by 30-60 fold.

#### Both perimeters in one data set

It is legal to have both pixel-walk perimeters and point-based perimeters.  Generally, the point-based perimeter should be used preferentially as it is likely to be more fully processed (smoothed, fit, etc.).

### Manipulation of custom data

Since custom data is associated with a set of timepoints, merging and splitting data by time requires custom data to be merged and split also.  This will happen according to the following rules in readers that supply facilities for merging and splitting data.

Custom data values must be one of the following to participate in splitting and merging of data points:

1. A simple value (not an array or object) that is the same for every data record with the same ID
2. An array of the same length as the number of timepoints
3. An object with values that are either arrays of the length of the number of timepoints, or are the same for every data record with the same ID

To split data, each array of the appropriate length retains each element corresponding to the retained timepoint(s); everything else is copied unchanged.  It is an error to have an array of an inappropriate length as custom value, or as a value for a key inside a custom object.  More deeply nested arrays are fine.

For example, the data in this WCON file can be split:

```JSON
{
    "units":{"t":"s", "x":"mm", "y":"mm"},
    "data":{
        "id":"1", "t":[0,1], "x":[2,3], "y":[4,5],
        "@XJ":{ "parameters": {"array": [1, 2, 3]} }
    }
}
```

but this cannot since `"parameters"` is an invalid length:

```JSON
{
    "units":{"t":"s", "x":"mm", "y":"mm"},
    "data":{
        "id":"1", "t":[0,1], "x":[2,3], "y":[4,5],
        "@XJ":{ "parameters": [1, 2, 3] }
    }
}
```

To merge custom data, arrays are merged so that each element continues to correspond to the same timepoint, and everything else is copied unchanged.

Any custom data that is not in the specified form may be dropped to make a merge or split succeed.

Readers may optionally provide better preservation of custom data by allowing a merge strategy to be specified in problematic cases.  In order of simplicity, these are

1. In a case where two values that should be identical are not, each could be duplicated into an array of the correct length.
2. In case a key is missing, it could be replaced a default value, or by an array of these defaults, as needed.
3. If only some keys of a custom object can be merged, a custom function could be called to merge the rest.
4. In the most general case, if anything goes wrong, a custom merge function could be called.

Readers that supply the first two of these options can treat custom data the same way as the WCON specification treats local values.  Readers supplied in the Tracker Commons project will typically implement these, and in any case will provide a way to inform the user when custom data has been dropped during a merge or split.

As an example of a non-problematic merge, if we merge the two data records in

```JSON
{
  "units":{"t":"s", "x":"mm", "y":"mm", "@XJ z":"mm", "c":"%" },
  "data":[
    {
      "id":"0", "t":[1,2], "x":[0,1], "y":[1,0],
      "@XJ z":[3,4], "@XJ g":9.8
    },
    {
      "id":"0", "t":[3,4,5], "x":[1,0,1], "y":[2,3,2],
      "@XJ z":[5,6,5], "@XJ g":9.8
    }
  ]
}
```

we will get

```JSON
{
  "units":{"t":"s", "x":"mm", "y":"mm", "@XJ z":"mm"},
  "data":[{
    "id":"0", "t":[1,2,3,4,5], "x":[0,1,1,0,1], "y":[1,0,2,3,2],
    "@XJ z":[3,4,5,6,5], "@XJ g":9.8
  }]
}
```

### Splitting large WCON files into chunks

For very long tracking experiments, it may be convenient to split a single experiment across multiple WCON files.  To make it easier to reconstruct tracks across files, we support a `files` entry in the main WCON object, that has three fields, `this`, `prev`, and `next`, subject to the following rules:

1. The variable part of the file name (for example a numerical suffix) is listed under `this` and is a string.
2. Other full file names are generated by replacing the variable part with different text.  (If the variable part occurs multiple times, the last instance should be replaced.)
3. If there is a next file, its variable part is listed in an array under `next`.  Not all files need to be listed (just the next one is enough), but the strings must be arrayed.  If there is no `next` file, the field can be missing or can have an empty array as its value.
4. If there is a previous file, its variable part is listed in an array under `prev`.  Again, not all files need to be listed.  If more than one is listed, it should be in **reverse** temporal order.

If a WCON file is split into chunks, it is assumed that use of animal `id` values is consistent.

In this example, we imagine a directory containing files labelled `filename_0.wcon`, `filename_1.wcon`, `filename_2.wcon`, and `filename_3.wcon`.  Then `filename_2.wcon` could look like this:

```JSON
{
    "files":{
        "this":"_2",
        "prev":["_1", "_0"],
        "next":["_3"]
     },
    "units":{"t":"s", "x":"mm", "y":"mm"},
    "data":{
      "id":"1", "t":[1.3], "x":[[7.2, 8.1]], "y":[[0.5, -0.1]]
    }
}
```

# Zipped files

Compressing JSON files typically offers space savings of an order of magnitude or more.  For this reason it is recommended that implementations allow files to be loaded and saved as [Zip archives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_(file_format)).  If so, files must end in `".zip"`.  It is further recommended (but not required) that they end in `".wcon.zip"`.  The extension of the WCON files within the `.zip` file must be `.wcon`.

A Zip archive can contain one or more WCON files:

- If an archive is loaded containing zero files, an error is raised.
- If an archive contains exactly one file, this file is loaded.
- If an archive contains more than one file, one file (not necessarily the first) is selected for loading.  If this file contains links via the "files" object in the specification (see above), then all linked files in the archive will be loaded.  Once all links are followed, if unread wcon files remain in the archive, an error is raised.
